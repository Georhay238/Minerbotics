	<h4 class="words" id="first-quote">"FIRST is more than robots. The robots are vehicle for students to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what to expect-of the program nor of themselves. They leave, even after the first season, with a vision, with confidence, and with a sense that they can create their own future." -Dean Kamen </h4>
